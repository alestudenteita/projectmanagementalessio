We got along from the very first moment thanks to our common passions for languages and cultures, as well as our working and team management style. During these years we kept in contact and we've been exchanging our experiences and opinions on work related matters. I have to admit that I admire the person he has become and his achievements so far, both on a professional and personal level. From my university experience with him, I know he is proactive and diligent in his job and open to confront others. What I appreciate the most about him, is his capability to apply the knowledge, his experience and his passion for tourism & languages developed during the last 10 years in every new situation he faces. He's following his compass and he knows where he's going. Hopefully one day we'll be able to be work colleagues. I wish you the best of luck Ale!</p>
